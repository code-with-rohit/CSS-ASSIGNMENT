      When the code is compiled/rendered by the browser, the browser ignores the
      HTML comments. Then, why should one write comments in HTML? So if you are
      working on a big project that includes complex code, you may easily lose
      track of and purpose of the code you write. In addition to that, if you
      are working with the team, other developers may not understand your code,
      and in that instance, the comments come in handy and play a vital role in
      understanding the piece of code. The comments in the HTML document are
      enclosed within special brackets and are not displayed on the webpage, but
      they will appear in our source code.
